            <h1 style="text-align:left;">My Diary</h1><hr>
            <h4 style="text-align:left;">Wednesday, January 8, 2020</h4>

            <p style="text-align:justify;"> Today, I learnt about creating a simple 5 page website and how to load this website on a public domain using github. I can now work with a simple html and css files. I also know how to organize my files in different folders according to their file type.
			I created using simple personal website using templates provided and uploaded it to github. I was able to make simple edits to the html files and I ubderstood most of the code used in the files provided. Uploading my website to github was a bit of a challenge but I was able to overcome it. Although, I will need to practice some more to become more efficient in this.
            </p> <p style="text-align: justify">I would love to learn more about coding and software development not just because I have a passing interest in it but beacuase I want to build a career from it. The process of creating a website or application is something I want to be able to do as my job because I want my job to be something that I enjoy</p>
